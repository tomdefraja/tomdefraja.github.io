I am a fourth year PhD student at Heriot-Watt University working under Richard Szabo. My research interests are in generalised geometry and how it applies to string theory. More recently I am interested in mathematical ecology.

I will (hopefully) submit my thesis this summer, after which I plan to take some time out. When I return I will be looking for jobs/postdocs in ecology and rewilding.

[comment]: <> (This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [Academic Pages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the repository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. Incidentally, these same features make it a great template for anyone that needs to show off a professional template!)
