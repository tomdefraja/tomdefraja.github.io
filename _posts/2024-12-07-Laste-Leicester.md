A warm send off from my family as I left our home, it is a great feeling setting off in descent on the loaded Dawes. I climb the Passo Campolongo, passed by cyclists with bikes and gear much more well suited for the roads, and surrounded by the truly remarkable scenery of the Dolomites. A quiet spot for lunch during the downpour gives way to more sun on the descent towards Brunico, which reverts to a storm toward the end of the day. A shelter by the bike path meant a place to set up camp, and despite the trains nearby, I sleep contented and excited for the rest of the journey.

I start the day with the climb up to the Brenner pass, which takes me into Austria, and from there a long and fun descent to Innsbruck. After a flat tyre and a subsequently broken pump, I enjoy a lunch by river Inn, watching a human-sized chess game play out. I know I have to change the rear tyre in Freising, and the steep forest track up to Achensee leaves me paranoid about a puncture, but riding along by Achensee lifts my concerns, and I find a spot in the forest nearby to camp.

A final push up the Achenpass into Germany, and it is pretty much downhill to Freising, where I visit some friends, Clara & Jonas (and baby Ludwig), for a few days. The topography in Germany flattens out remarkably fast, and I could look back for miles on the alps while enjoying lunch, reflecting on how far I have come. Joining the Isar in Munich, it is just a matter of following the river to Freising.
