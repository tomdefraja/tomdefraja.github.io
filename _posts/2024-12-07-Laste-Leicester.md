A warm send off from my family as I left our home, it was a great feeling setting off in descent on the loaded Dawes. I climbed the Passo Campolongo, being passed by cyclists much more well suited for the roads, and surrounded by the truly remarkable scenery of the Dolomites. A quiet spot for lunch during the downpour gave way to more sun on the descent into the Brenner, which reverted to a storm toward the end of the day. A shelter by the bike path meant a place to set up camp, and despite the trains nearby, I slept contented and excited for the rest of the journey.

I started the day with the climb up the Brenner, which took me into Austria, and from there a long and fun descent into Innsbruck. After a flat tyre and a subsequently broken pump, I enjoyed a lunch by the Inn watching human-size chess. I knew I had to change the rear tyre in Freising, and the steep forest track up to lake Achensee left me paranoid about a puncture, but riding along the lake lifted my concerns, and I found a spot in the forest nearby to camp.

A final push up the Achenpass into Germany, and it was pretty much downhill to Freising, where I visited some friends, Clara & Jonas (and baby Ludwig), for a few days. The topography flattened out remarkably fast, and I could look back on the alps while enjoying lunch. Joining the Isar in Munich, it was just a matter of following the track to Freising.
