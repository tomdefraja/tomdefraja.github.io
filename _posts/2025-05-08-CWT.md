Fort William - Knoydart
=====

Day 1
-----
A guilty lunch in Wetherspoons and a final glance at the weather forecast, the ferry takes us to the start of the trail. The walk north starts southbound along the road, and we set off along side a surprising number of Germans and an Irishman, Kevin, all doing the CWT. The 10km trudge on the tarmac with full backpacks (including >8 days of food, 4 litres of sparkling water and 3 bottles of Lidlâ€™s finest Whiskey) made for a tough start, but a gravel track and a shrine-like collection of painted pebbles heralded the start of the walk in earnest. 

We continue up Cona Glenn, whose south side was full of golden sun and the sound of cuckoos, we run into Kevin's camp, who tells us he aims to walk until the weather turns, he hopes to make it to Ullapool. We made camp outside the shut Corrlarach Bothy.

Day 2
-----

Continuing on Cona Glenn, up the pass and to Glenfinnan, we cooled off in the Finnan by Corryhully bothy. Over the pass --- after strangely bumping into a pure mathematician --- what is usually an endless bog was instead a pleasant descent towards Loch Arkaig, and we ventured toward a busy A'Chuil bothy, where we camped outside.

Day 3
-----

After removing a large amount of ticks in the morning (lesson learnt not to go about long grass in sliders and no socks), we made our way over the Bealach and down towards Sourlies, which apparently had over 14 tents out the night before thanks to the TGO coast to coast event. Crossing the estuary we watched a herd of deer cooling off by wading out into the sea. Another fun pass we approached Inverie, left our tent outside the town and headed for the pub, The Old Forge. 
By chance there happened to be a wonderful gig that night, the duo of Catherine MacLellan and Lucy Farrel, and we dined on the out-of-date crisps they were giving away for free.
