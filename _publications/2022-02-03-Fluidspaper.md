Thin-film-based nanoporous membrane technologies exploit evaporation to efficiently cool microscale and nanoscale electronic devices. At these scales, when domain sizes become comparable to the mean-free path in the vapor, traditional macroscopic approaches such as the Navier-Stokes-Fourier (NSF) equations become less accurate, and the use of higher-order moment methods is called for. Two higher-order moment equations are considered; the linearized versions of the Grad 13 and Regularized 13 equations. These are applied to the problem of nanoporous evaporation, and results are compared to the NSF method and the method of direct simulation Monte Carlo (i.e., solutions to the Boltzmann equations). Linear and nonlinear versions of the boundary conditions are examined, with the latter providing improved results, at little additional computational expense, compared to the linear form. The outcome is a simultaneously accurate and computationally efficient method, which can provide simulation-for-design capabilities at the nanoscale.
